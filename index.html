    <h3>Career Objective</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      A proactive Master of IT Graduate is looking for a position as an IT
      Support Technician. I am passionate about Information Technology, and this
      is the main reason that I proceeded with my post-study at USYD after my
      commerce degree. My Weighted Average Mark in School of IT has maintained
      above Distinction in the University of Sydney. From my experience in the
      school of IT, I have gained a solid understanding of computer
      organizations, networking, and routing mechanisms. My fundamental software
      development projects in Python and Java both achieved full marks. Database
      implementation was also covered in both my Capstone Project and one of the
      university courses. Additionally, I am proficient in Tableau as data
      visualization was extensively applied in my several projects back at the
      University. My previous work as a junior officer also includes installing
      and configuring computer software and accounts for new users and setting
      up printers for the office. Helping non-tech people solve technical issues
      is enjoyable for me. I would like to contribute my knowledge and
      experience to a professional workplace.
